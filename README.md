# Vaisakh's Machine Learning Course Projects Repository

Welcome to my Machine Learning Course Projects Repository! This repository is a record of my journey in learning machine learning, and it currently includes a project on Linear Regression and data visualization using Matplotlib and Pandas.

## Project 1: Linear Regression and Data Visualization

- **Description:** This project focuses on implementing Linear Regression, a fundamental machine learning algorithm, to predict a target variable based on one or more input features. Additionally, I have used Matplotlib and Pandas to visualize the data, understand its distribution, and gain insights.

- **Techniques Used:**
  - Linear Regression
  - Pandas for data manipulation
  - Matplotlib for data visualization

- **Results:** In this project, I learned how to:
  - Perform data preprocessing and cleaning.
  - Implement simple linear regression and multiple linear regression.
  - Visualize data using Matplotlib to understand relationships between variables.
  - Evaluate the performance of the regression models.

 
Feel free to explore this project to understand how Linear Regression can be applied to real-world data and how data visualization can help in gaining insights.
